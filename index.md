### A natural argument for contextualism

In the debate between contextualist and standard invariantist theories of knowledge, linguistic data have been the primary focus. This paper comes at the debate from a very different angle: I argue that contextualism is much better than standard invariantism at respecting the natural – i.e., objectively metaphysically privileged – structure of reality. From this, I draw three further conclusions: first, that contextualism is much better than standard invariantism at making sense of the idea that knowledge has a distinctive normative significance; second, that contextualism is, in one important respect, much more charitable than standard invariantism; finally, that if standard invariantism is nonetheless true, then we should replace our word “know” with a more natural word – perhaps its contextualist analog.

### Responsibility for Recommendations

Recommender systems are now a dominant part of most social media platforms. They play important roles for the billions of people worldwide who access these sites/apps each day. The typical user experience on these platforms consists of an endless stream of recommended posts to read, images to admire, videos to watch, users to follow, groups to join, and more. However, these systems have also been accused of contributing to horrific violence, including the ongoing crisis in Myanmar. This talk argues social media companies share responsibility for the harms that occur on their platforms by demonstrating how they are constitutive intermediaries, not the not mere intermediaries they (sometimes) claim to be. I use speech act theory and the concept of affordances to illuminate the contribution that platform companies make to our communicative acts, showing how platforms shape users’ speech, and also perform important speech acts themselves, with particular focus on recommendations.

### Why skepticism about AI is wrong 

Many commentators maintain a skeptical position in the wake of the resent surge of success in the field of AI. Such positions include claims that Language Models are essentially “stochastic parrots” that simply regurgitate probabilistic word sequences (Bender et al, 2021), or that they are better understood as function approximators or compression algorithms (e.g Chiang, 2022). I argue that this family of skeptical positions relies on an implicit model of these forms of artificial cognition as a massive idiosyncratic encoding of abstruse and arbitrary features of the training data.

Emerging evidence from computer science paints a radically different picture: that Deep Neural Networks encode sensible and generalisable representations of the target domain (e.g Morcos et al, 2018), and that they exhibit a spectacular level of convergence (e.g Ainsworth et al, 2022).

The skeptical view, properly understood, leaves no room for the capabilities that actually make successful AI models successful. Many skeptical claims simply describe the characteristics of flawed AI models, which tend to engage in overfitting: sheer memorisation, and an inability to generalise from their training data. Successful AI models are successful because they are capable of precisely what the skeptic denies them.
