### What is Interesting about Conspiracy Theories? 

A central debate in conspiracy theory research concerns how to conceptualize conspiracy theories in a way that advances our understanding of the phenomena and those who believe in them. This debate remains unresolved, with researchers adopting widely different positions: while some argue for a purely descriptive understanding, others seem strongly committed to the view that conspiracy theories are, or can be shown to be, inherently irrational. This paper reconstructs the controversy, arguing that it stems from two distinct scholarly motives: to attain objective knowledge of the phenomena in question versus to defend beliefs and norms that are part of the researcher’s own cultural context. By examining the epistemological and methodological challenges in this field, I highlight how competing frameworks—normative cultural biases versus objective scientific inquiry—shape our understanding of rational belief. When cultural biases influence research, they risk narrowing its scope and undermining the development of a comprehensive understanding of conspiracy theories. Ultimately, even proponents of normative cultural approaches can acknowledge that such perspectives fail to capture the full complexity and significance of these phenomena.

### Commercial surrogacy as illegitimate work

Is surrogacy a form of legitimate work? Or does the nature of pregnancy and parenthood render surrogacy illegitimate? In this presentation I argue that the best strategy in defence of commercial surrogacy—which I call the “surrogacy-as-legitimate-work” strategy—relies on two implicit assumptions and that once we make them explicit, we are forced to see that commercial surrogacy inevitably leads to a conflict of core moral rights. As I hope to show, if commercial surrogacy is a type of work, it is work that cannot simultaneously protect the right of the surrogate mother to opt out and the right of the commissioning couple to exercise ultimate authority over the foetus.

### Epistemic Actions Revisited (or: I Actively Infer a Riot)

**[Note: this seminar will take place in the Moot Court on level 2 (Room 224).]**

Kirsh and Maglio’s (1994) paper “On distinguishing Epistemic from Pragmatic Action” contrasts ‘epistemic’ actions which have a primarily cognitive payoff, from ‘pragmatic’ ones which advance towards an established goal. They also argue that people demonstrably engage in epistemic actions. Their idea of ‘epistemic actions’ has featured in many defences of extended cognition and been developed and updated for use in talk of cognitive niche construction and in other ways. As originally introduced, besides having a cognitive payoff, epistemic actions have two distinguishing features, both stipulated rather than defended: First, agents do epistemic actions for themselves. Second, the effect of (successful) epistemic actions is beneficial. Subsequent work has generally retained both stipulations. In this talk I develop a generalized picture of epistemic actions that retains the idea that their main effect is cognitive but abandons the ‘DIY’ assumption to allow for both self-and other-directed epistemic actions and abandons the ‘beneficial’ assumption to allow for both beneficial and hostile epistemic actions. (That is hostile in the sense used by Kim Sterelny.) Andy Clark has recently argued that from a predictive processing perspective that accommodates active inference, pragmatic and epistemic actions are not ‘fundamentally distinct’. I take this on board as a constraint and explain how the categories of other-directed beneficial epistemic actions and of other-directed hostile epistemic actions can, at least informally, be accommodated as forms of active inference. The generalized framework suggests the further and perhaps surprising possibility of self-directed hostile epistemic actions. I explain why that needn’t be a ridiculous idea, and argue that cognitive self-sabotage is, subject to some conditions, a coherent possibility. Unlike the other additions I defend here, self-sabotage cannot straightforwardly be accommodated by the predictive processing/active inference perspective. In that case either we can’t have both, or we need to make changes to the predictive processing framework.

### Large language models in large language games

When I receive an email making a promise, giving me an order, or offering me a job, have I in fact been promised, ordered, or offered? Until recently, we may have easily said ‘Yes!’… but AI is complicating things. As large language models capable of output mimicking human speech become widely available, we can no longer be as confident that the email (or other online communication) we receive has a human author. Traditional theories of speech acts—the things we do with words, including promises, orders, and offers—set great store in the intention of the speaker or the uptake of the audience. But neither, I will argue, are well-suited to explaining modern online speech. What to do about this? I’ll sketch out an alternative speech act theory, grounding the force of an utterance in the conversational score, rather than the minds of speakers and audiences. This, I hope, will better explain how we interact in the post-AI online landscape. It might also be useful for explaining offline speech acts. What to do about this?

### Fine Attention, Broad Awareness: Maintaining Awareness to Avoid the Cost of Ignorance

Is it sometimes valuable to diminish one’s awareness? An affirmative answer has been given in a number of recent discussions. First, it has been suggested that sometimes increased awareness is too painful to be of value. Georgi Gardiner, for example, has argued that a the kind of mental block found in self-deception can be the most rational response is cases of acquaintance rape. Second, some argue that there are cases where forgetting is what is needed to treat people with respect, or in order to forgive others when forgiveness is called for. Finally, it may seem that intellectual humility demands that we diminish awareness of our intellectual capacities. I argue that in all these cases, what is being suggested is that we not place or heighten our attention on certain events, memories or capacities. But awareness and attention differ. Once this distinction is made, I argue that diminishing one’s awareness is never good.

### Self-Narrative, Diachronic Stability, and Self-Governance: A Defence of the Ethical Narrativity Thesis

There have been several attempts to defend the Ethical Narrativity Thesis (ENT), that is, the claim that people ought to develop and live according to a self-narrative because it is essential to living well or flourishing. Existing arguments for the ENT have several weaknesses, some rely on an excessively narrow view of flourishing, one sets the threshold for self-narrative so low that the concept is rendered trivial, others only promote a limited ENT whereby self-narratives enable valuable kinds of emotional experience but don’t influence agency. I put forward a novel argument for the ENT that avoids these weaknesses. I claim that self-narratives provide a powerful and irreplicable means of diachronically stabilising intentions because they are ideally suited to anticipating, constructing, and shaping our perspectives over time. As such, self-narration is a valuable tool for achieving self-governance. My view entails that people who don’t self-narrate are relatively vulnerable to failures of self-governance due to temptation and the cognitive burden of deliberation. Self-governance is a necessary (but insufficient) condition for flourishing so people who self-narrate will, ceteris paribus, flourish more than those who do not.
