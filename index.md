### If it Pleases the Gods: The Socratic Piety of Epictetus

Epictetus’ Stoicism is distinguished by the centrality of Socrates, who serves as both role model and authorizer of the core teachings in the Discourses. A second distinctive feature is Epictetus’ unique conception of piety and the central importance he assigns to this virtue. The primary aim of this paper is to elucidate Epictetian piety and its Socratic origins. Epictetian piety comprises three attitudes inspired by the life and teachings of Socrates: optimism, gratitude, and obedience. After outlining the nature and interrelations of these attitudes, I explain how Epictetian piety can be manifested independent of religious belief. I argue that this form of piety is a neglected virtue that can promote human flourishing and ethical living in a modern secular context.
