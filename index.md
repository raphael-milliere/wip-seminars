# Schedule for Semester 2, 2024

Unless otherwise noted, all seminars will be held from 13:00–14:30 in Room 224 (Moot Court) in the Philosophy Department’s new building at 17 Wally’s Walk.

The seminars are followed by afternoon tea (that quaintest of Australian traditions—but yes, there’s coffee too) with the speaker, seminar attendees, and other members of the Philosophy Department.
